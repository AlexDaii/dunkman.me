This talk covered sharing state between tabs — and I’ve released a set of [minimalist code samples on GitHub](https://github.com/adunkman/client-side-sync-examples) to demonstrate every particular way I can think of to do this. I don’t believe the slides for this talk are particularly useful, but [the slides are available on Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/adunkman/beyond-the-tab-executing-javascript-across-browser-contexts-at-nodevember).

**Stopping Hate:** The first section of this talk covered hate crimes in the United States after the election. [Donate to the SPLC](https://donate.splcenter.org/). [Here are all the hate crimes reported since Trump was elected president](http://www.revelist.com/us-news/donald-trump-hate-crimes/5796). I directly referenced:

**Browser Support:** Check [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake)’s excellent site, [Is ServiceWorker Ready?](https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/) for browser compatibility information.

**Push Notifications:** The [demo for push notifications shown during the talk is available on GitHub](https://github.com/gauntface/simple-push-demo). For more information about sending notifications to users through the Push API, check out [Using the Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API/Using_the_Push_API) on MDN.

**Background Sync:** For more information on [syncing web applications in the background, see this blog post on developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/12/background-sync), complete with a link to a chameleon popping bubbles.
